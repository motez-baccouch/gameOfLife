# Game of Life Simulation

This project is inspired by the [Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Plq-D1gEk) on the Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Conway. The Game of Life is known for its simplicity yet ability to produce complex and unpredictable patterns.

## Inspiration

John Conway's inspiration for the Game of Life can be traced back to the concept of self-replicating machines proposed by mathematician and computer scientist John von Neumann. Additionally, the idea of "robots on Mars" or self-replicating machines exploring the universe influenced Conway's thinking about the emergent behavior in cellular automata.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): A JavaScript library for creative coding.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/motez-baccouch/gameOfLife.git
cd gameOfLife
```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
